# The Standard Model

An open source toolkit for simulating and visualizing particle interactions as described by the Standard Model

# Components

The project consists of multiple components that complete different jobs involved in simulating particle interactions.

## Standard Model Library

The Standard Model library encapsulates the mathematics behind the Standard Model, as well as defining structures for the representation of particles, among other things.

## Simulator Library

The simulator library contains code to be shared by the editor and the simulator itself. This includes, for example, code defining the data at the beginning of a simulation configuration file which sets various simulation parameters. These are written by the editor to allow the user to specify the conditions to simulate and read by the simulator to load this data at runtime and begin the simulation.

## Simulator

The simulator executable reads simulation configuration files created by the editor, runs the simulation as requested, and generates a new binary file describing the evolution of the described system over time.

## Editor

The editor executable is an interactive program that allows the user to build the initial conditions of a desired simulation before writing the configuration to a file that can be read by the simulator.

## Renderer

The renderer executable reads files generated by the simulator and renders the system, outputting the graphics data to a video file, visually showing the system's evolution over time.
